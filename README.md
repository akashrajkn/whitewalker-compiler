##All programs must DIE. All programs must SERVE

This repo is a simple implementation of compiler for a new esoteric language "</b>WhiteWalker</b>" (yup, GoT fan)

A simple translation, <b>All programs must die</b>. Each program written in this language must start with "ValarMorghulis". The program is ended withe the token, "ValarDohaeris" (<b>All programs must serve</b> :P).

"WW Grammar.txt" contains the grammar of this new language. The compiler is written in two simple C programs - lexer and parser.

"input.txt" contains a sample program.
